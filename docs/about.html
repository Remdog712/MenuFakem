    <p class="story">
        Our journey began over a century ago, when our great-great-grandparents planted their very first orange trees. Nestled in the heart of sunny groves, they worked the land with nothing but passion, sweat, and a deep love for the humble orange. Over the years, our family has cultivated an orange empire, where generations have toiled under the sun, nurturing trees that have seen the test of time.

    <p class="story">
        Fast forward to today, and we’re still squeezing every drop of flavor from our oranges. But times have changed, and so have we. Enter the <span class="highlight">QR code menu</span> – our “trendy” answer to modern dining. There’s something we can’t help but find amusing about watching customers as they fumble with their phones, squinting to find the right angle, trying desperately to capture that elusive scan.

    <p class="story">
        Some call it progress; we call it entertainment. After all, nothing pairs better with fresh orange juice than a little lighthearted struggle. So, thank you for being part of this new tradition – because, if there’s one thing we’ve learned over the years, it’s that life (and good juice) is all about the experience.
